# GestureTrajectoriesVR

Project adapted from Jay Henderson's original GestureTrajectoriesInVR/TrackHands.

Unity Version 2022.3.1
Tested Using Oculus Quest 2 in Rift mode (connected to a PC)

Start from the InputScene and input a participant ID (doesn't matter what it is).

Once you hit enter it should take you to the IntroScene. Use the red button to the 
left to play/pause the intro video. The button to move on to the next scene will
appear when the video ends.

Based on your participant ID you will be put into one of the condition scenes. 
Here you will be shown another video explaining the condition and a play/pause button. 
The button to move on will appear when the video ends and then you will cycle through 
the required gestures. To complete a gesture use either a point or pinch hand pose to 
draw the required shape.
